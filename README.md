# Download Manager In Go
This is a download manager that I'm making entirely in go.

# Building
run the following command to run without making an executable:

`go run dmig.go`

or to build an executable...

`go build dmig.go`


# TODO
- [x] Ask for url of file to download instead of needing to edit source
- [ ] Add progress bar/percentage
