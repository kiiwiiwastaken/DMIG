# Download Manager In Go
This is a download manager that I'm making entirely in go.

# Building
`go mod init dmig`

`go build dmig.go`

# TODO
- [x] Ask for url of file to download instead of needing to edit source
- [x] Add progress bar/percentage
- [ ] Have automatic file naming
- [ ] Assume the url is https by default
